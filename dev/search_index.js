The key AFM component is a nanoscale tip attached to a cantilever that is indented within the material. The deflection of the cantilever is read via a laser directly pointed towards the indenting end of the cantilever. By knowing the spring constant of the cantilever and the deflection of the laser, the force applied to the sample can be calculated. ","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"There are different modes of operation in which an AFM can be used. The easiest way is to indent the probe at constant rate within the sample with a given force while recording the tip deflection. Another common class of tests are known as viscoelastic measurements: the cantilever is indented within the sample at a given force, and the force or the measured displacement is kept constant for a given time (i.e. creep and relaxation tests). The recorded time-force-displacement values allow us to extract the mechanical properties of the tested material.

This interface allows the user to fit the experimental data not only with a simple elastic model, but with a wide variety of viscoelastic constitutive models (for more information refer to RHEOS models).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Features-1","page":"Home","title":"Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"RHEOSafm package provides the utilities to:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"build a direct interface with a widely commercially available testing set-up, RHEOSafm provides features to directly import experimental data collected using BRUKER - JPK products;\nidentify the contact point.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Documentation-1","page":"Home","title":"Documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The sections in this documentation each aim to provide tutorials for the elements of RHEOSafm.
